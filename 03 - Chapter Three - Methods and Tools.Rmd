## Prediction or Inference?

I will use both ones. In other words, the intention is to carefully analyze the information and data and find the most important and influential variables that affect educational success or failure. Then design a model to predict the current situation and make suggestions to improve the educational quality of schools and students’ achievements.

## Main Tool

R is statistical software that has a large and rich library that allows me to easily perform various methods in the least amount of computation time.

## Methods

There are two data mining approaches; Classification (Dealing with discrete variables) and Regression (continuous variables). Given that conditions, I should consider the final grades as a pass and fail object and use classification methods here. 


**From Linear Regression to Non – Linear Approaches**
 
It is always a good idea, to begin with, simple approaches at first and then make the model more complicated step by step. 
That is why I first investigate the classical methods such as linear regression and its generalized versions like best subset and stepwise selections and then move on to non – linear ones to see if I can improve the model or not. 

**SVMs and Decision Trees**

Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning method with associated learning algorithms applied mostly for classification problems. It supports linear and non – linear approaches. 

Three methods are best for analyzing responses including continuous variables with discrete ones as predictors. The results are also easy to interpret and explain to non-experts and have a nice graphical output. 

The process of the DT approach should work well on this data as there are many predictors divided by classified groups.

In chapter six, I am going to combine two methods named bagging and random forests with DT to make it more effective and improve its prediction accuracy as well.

In the final chapter, I would explain and compare the best models in much more detail.
