## Prediction or Inference?

I will use both ones. In other words, the intention is to carefully
analyze the information and data and find the most important and
influential variables that affect educational success or failure. Then
design a model to predict the current situation and make suggestions to
improve the educational quality of schools and students’ achievements.

## Main Tool

R is statistical software that has a large and rich library that allows
me to easily perform various methods in the least amount of computation
time.

## Methods

There are two data mining approaches; Classification (Dealing with
discrete variables) and Regression (continuous variables). Given that
conditions, I should consider the final grades as a pass and fail object
and use classification methods here.

**From Linear Regression to Non – Linear Approaches**

It is always a good idea, to begin with, simple approaches at first and
then make the model more complicated step by step. That is why I first
investigate the classical methods such as linear regression and its
generalized versions like best subset and stepwise selections and then
move on to non – linear ones to see if I can improve the model or not.

**SVMs and Decision Trees**

Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning method with
associated learning algorithms applied mostly for classification
problems. It supports linear and non – linear approaches.

Three methods are best for analyzing responses including continuous
variables with discrete ones as predictors. The results are also easy to
interpret and explain to non-experts and have a nice graphical output.

The process of the DT approach should work well on this data as there
are many predictors divided by classified groups.

In chapter six, I am going to combine two methods named bagging and
random forests with DT to make it more effective and improve its
prediction accuracy as well.

In the final chapter, I would explain and compare the best models in
much more detail.
